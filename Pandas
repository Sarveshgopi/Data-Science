Pandas is a package in python, which is used to analyse data.

//Import Pandas
import pandas as pd

Two objects are important in pandas : DataFrame and Series.

DataFrame:

A DataFrame is a table. It contains an array of individual entries, each of which has a certain value. Each entry corresponds to a row (or record) and a column.

For example, consider the following simple DataFrame:

pd.DataFrame({'Yes': [50, 21], 'No': [131, 2]}, index=["0","1"])

Yes	No
0	50	131
1	21	2

Series:

A Series, by contrast, is a sequence of data values. If a DataFrame is a table, a Series is a list. And in fact you can create one with nothing more than a list:

pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], index=["0","1","2","3","4"], name="example", dtype="int64")

0    1
1    2
2    3
3    4
4    5

Name: example, dtype: int64
